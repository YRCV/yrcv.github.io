(a) inspired by diode.computer, 3d model by damongraphics on Sketchfab (I made the render and effects myself), hosted on github pages

to-do:
- add my favorite music as a little cd player
- add indicators to hover over pcb and switch light and dark modes
- add some cool sounds effects
- stylize the projects page
- add a cursors trail or a little companion
- add a page for smaller thoughts
- write first blog

still have a lot of features and polish to do '-', and i have to add a dragon somewhere
