            <div class="article-body">
                <p>In the past few years, Artificial intelligence has been rapidly accelerating to the point that it is even being used as an assistant in medicine. AI tools have been proven to help doctors spot tumors that the human eye might miss, make the diagnosis process faster, and even accurately predict patient risks. However, a study published in The Lancet Gastroenterology & Hepatology has revealed an unsettling side effect: after just three months of using AI tools designed to help finding precancerous signs during colonoscopies, doctors became significantly less able to find them on their own.</p>

                <p>The numbers are striking. Before the AI tool was introduced, doctors at four endoscopy centers in Poland were successfully detecting adenomas (a growth that can develop into colon cancer) at a rate of 28.4%. After three months of working with AI, the rate dropped to 22.4% when they had to perform colonoscopies without assistance. That six percent decline represents real people and patients whose pre-cancerous signs may go unnoticed (Budzyń et al., 2025).</p>

                <p>This is scientific evidence of what many are calling “deskilling”, the gradual decay of medical practitioner's foundational clinical skills and judgment. This phenomenon is not isolated to medicine; airline pilots have been dealing with similar issues for years. Studies have shown that manual flying skills erode when pilots spend the majority of their time monitoring the autopilot instead of actively controlling the plane (Casner et. al, 2014). With the adoption of AI rapidly accelerating, the implications and considerations in medicine are only now becoming a central focus.</p>

                <p>The risk here is not simply forgetting a procedure, it's fundamentally altering the cognitive and conscious engagement of the medical practitioner with the job itself. Offloading the burden of pattern recognition and careful attention results in a lack of practice to maintain human skill. In other words, it's like learning to ride a bike and then putting the training wheels back on.</p>

                <h2>Not All Deskilling Is Created Equal</h2>

                <p>This situation is more complex than the simple “man vs machine” trope. Dr. Robert Wachter, chair of the medicine department at the University of California, San Francisco, who recently authored a book on AI transforming healthcare points out that there are many harmless examples of technology making old skills obsolete. Very few physicians today could examine a patient's heart and lungs without a stethoscope, as was common practice during the 1700s. That is a skill loss that we don't mourn. “I think the big question is going to be: So what? Is that important?” Dr. Wachter said.</p>

                <p>The problem is multifaceted. Is it so bad for doctors to have their own "autopilot" style situation if it means that there are higher cancer detection rates? Higher detection rates mean fewer missed cancers, and more lives saved; the collaboration between humans and algorithms can clearly increase lives saved, regardless of whether medical practitioners become slightly less sharp when working alone at an individual level.</p>

                <p class="pull-quote">"Who is watching the watcher?"</p>

                <p>There's another issue of supervision. Unlike a stethoscope, AI systems require that humans monitor it. This is because algorithms are trained on data that is inherently from the past. As the world changes in real time, their performance can sometimes fall behind and fail to adapt. AI can be heavily influenced by unexpected factors like the changes in lighting in a medical room, which can cause the results of it to go in a completely different direction. Doctors are supposed to catch those errors. But if their own skills have eroded… who is watching the watcher?</p>

                <h2>The Next Generation of Practitioners</h2>

                <p>One of the most troubling questions is what will happen to current medical trainees. The physicians in the Polish study had, on average, about 27 years of experience. This means they had decades of developing and training their diagnostic skills and instincts without AI interference. What will happen to medical students who are learning to perform procedures with AI assistance from day one?</p>

                <p>“We're increasingly calling it never-skilling,” said Dr. Rodman, director of AI programs at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, to the New York Times. Never-skilling; not losing skills you had, but never building them in the first place. Back to the bike analogy: this isn't taking the training wheels off and wobbling; this is never taking them off at all.</p>

                <p>The concern is that medical students may never take the time to develop their foundations, something that many older doctors take for granted. If you only learn to detect cancers by following the AI's green boxes, will you ever develop the pattern recognition to find them without on your own? Clinical reasoning, the ability to synthesize patient data, form hypotheses, and make diagnoses, is what separates a physician from a technician following instructions.</p>

                <p>So how is medical education preparing for this? Not well. Data from the Association of American Medical Colleges exposes the reality of the medical education system struggling, or rather, refusing to adapt. More than half of medical schools lack an appropriate institutional use policy for AI. Only 30% of schools provide students with secure access to an AI tool for learning (AAMC, 2024). Many schools are adding AI coursework to their curriculums, but often without frameworks to ensure their effectiveness.</p>

                <p>The governing bodies of medical education have begun to respond. The American Medical Association has encouraged accrediting bodies to acknowledge and address AI in their training standards (AMA, n.d.). The AAMC has published principles that emphasize critical thinking and human judgment (AAMC, 2023). But transitioning from principles into real practice takes time, and many institutions have shown resistance. The Liaison Committee of Medical Education, responsible for accrediting U.S. and Canadian schools to be able to give the M.D., has yet to incorporate any AI competencies into its formal standards. In fact, there is no mention of AI at all.</p>

                <h2>Future Outlooks</h2>

                <p>The challenge lies in separating the skills worth preserving from the skills that can safely become obsolete. As philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah recently wrote, “Every advance has cost something. Literacy dulled feats of memory but created new powers of analysis. Calculators did a number on mental arithmetic; they also enabled more people to “do the math.” Recorded sound weakened everyday musical competence but changed how we listen.” (Appiah, 2025). The question is not whether AI will change medicine; it already is. The question is which human skills need to be protected, and which we are fine with losing.</p>

                <p>For the time being, the doctors from Poland offer a cautionary data point. It didn't take years for their skills to atrophy. Three months was enough. As AI tools continue to spread across the medical disciplines, from primary care to radiology to neurology, the experiment continues to expand, ready or not.</p>

                <p>The doctors didn't notice their own decline as it was happening. The erosion was only visible in data from thousands of combined procedures. Three months. That's all it took. And they didn't even feel it happening.</p>
